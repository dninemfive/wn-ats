A set of Python tools (using [ndf-parse](https://github.com/Ulibos/ndf-parse)) to do things like profile types used in the ndf files and summarize statistic ranges for specific units.

# Current features
- Type profiler: generates Python types for every type which shows up in the existing NDF files

# Planned features
- Generate summaries for division unit distributions and counts
- Determine whether a mod is reasonably balanced relative to vanilla or another mod
- Summarize the distribution of values for any given variable
